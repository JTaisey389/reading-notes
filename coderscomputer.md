# Welcome to the coders computer!

### Choosing a text editor
I am all new to this enviroment of writing code and choosing the optimum text editor that best suits my needs. At the moment I have visual code setup on my computer, but my interaction at this point has been very minimal. My understanding of a text editor is a software that intereacts with your computer to manage and create text to build a website.

### Features of a text editor
- Code completion: Essentially suggests the code that you are trying to write, and also is a wonderfull tool to autocorrect. If you make a typo on your code, that could completely throw off everything in your website. I would full aniticipate this code completion would increase the amount of productivity.

- Syntax Highlighting: This I interpret as a way to read the individual lines of code that you have created. If you are thousands of lines deep into a code, having a color coding system helps you identify errors faster.

- Themes: Just as it says you can change the "theme of how your software displays the code you've written. It's suggested to find something that suits your eyes to minimize strain. 

- Extensions: Extensions are the plugins for your text editor, you can add addtional functionality to you code. This feature could allow a user to save the basic framework of a code as so the user doesn't have to create new code.
