# How Computers Work

### WHat makes a computer function:
- A thinking machine would need to complete at least four tasks.
 1. Take input
 2. Store information
 3. Process the input
 4. Output the results
These are common to all computers. At one point computers were the size of whole rooms. The computer was originally just designed to do calculations, now computers fit into the palm of your hand.

### Input:
You have touch screens
Heart rate monitors
Fingerprint sensors
Water sensors

### Store Information:
The input is stored in its memory. The memory will manipulate the information in a series of algorithms or commands

### Process the input:
The computer will process the input it's received and put the files in the locations based on commands it has been given

### Output the results:
A computer will output information based on the input it has received. A calculator is a great example of input from the user and then output from the stored information.

### Data & Binary
Computers work on ones and zeros. A computer has wires within its hardware and can have either the following commands. This on-off state is a bit, when you use more wires you can have more bits.
 1. 1 or 0
 2. True or False
 3. Yes or No
 4. On or off
Binary number system consists of:
- 1's position
- 2's position
- 4's position
- 8's position

### Text In Binary
When you assign a number to a letter, this corresponds to a number in the binary code.
Dog for example in binary would be: 
 -4, 15, 7
 -In binary that is 001000111100111

### Circuits and Logic
To process the information that is input, to do this small components called circuits can modify and process information.
Within circuits there are logic gates:
 1. And
 2. Nand
 3. Not
 4. Nor
 5. Or
 6. Xor

For example, you can have a circuit take in two bits, this is called an adder.

### CPU, Memory, Input & Output
When you press a letter on your keyboard, the keyboard converts the letter into a binary number. From there a CPU calculates how to display the letter, and the CPU pulls from the memory on how to draw the letter. Modern computers have multiple CPUs and large amounts of memory.

### Hardware and Software
When you look into a computer you see the hardware that makes up the computer. Within the hardware, you have the software that runs the CPU or the Central Processing Unit. Command inputs provide a CPU a directive on what it should. CPU's pull from the memory a set of parameters that are pre-installed to run the files to make the CPU work. Each computer has an Operating system that interacts with the various computer systems.
