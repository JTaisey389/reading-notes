# How Computers Work

### WHat makes a computer function:
- A thinking machine would need to complete at least four task's.
    1. Take input
    2. Store information
    3. Process the input
    4. Output the results
These are common to all computers. At one point computers were the size of whole rooms.The computer was orginally just designed to do calculations, now computers fit into the palm of your hand.

### Input:
You have touch screens
Heart rate monitors
Finger print sensors
Water sensors

### Store Information:
The input is stored in it's memory. Memory will manipulate the information in a series of algorythims or commands

### Process the input:
The computer will process the input it's received and put the files in the locations based off of comands it has been given

### Output the results:
A computer will output information based on the input it has received. A calculator is a great example of an input from the user and then an output from the stored information.

### Data & Binary
Computers work on ones and zeros. A computer has wires within it's hardware and can have either the following commands.This on off state is a bit, when you use more wires you can have more bits.
    1. 1 or 0
    2. True or False
    3. Yes or No
    4. On or off
Binary number system consist of:
- 1's position
- 2's position
- 4's position
- 8's position

### Text In Binary
When you assign a number to a letter, this corrisponds to a number in the binary code.
Dog for example in binary would be: 
    -4, 15, 7
    -In binary that is 001000111100111

### Circuits and Logic
To process the information that is input, to do this small components called circuts can modify and process information.
Within circuits there are logic gates:
    1. And
    2. Nand
    3. Not
    4. Nor
    5. Or
    6. Xor
