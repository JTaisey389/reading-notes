# Structure web pages with HTML

### Process and Design:
Individuals:
Who is your target audience? 
* Is there a specific country you want your website to appeal to?
* What is the average income of the visitors
* What is their occupation

### What brings people to visit your website?
* Create a list as to why people come to your website
* Do these individuals want specific information

### What information is needed to convey to the visitor?
* Are they familiar with the brand or subject area, or do you have to introduce yourself?

### How often does the user visit the website?
* Does the website need to change seasonally?
* Updating a website can be costly to do frequently
* Working out how often people visit your site provides you with a model of how often the site should be updated

### Sitemaps and why they are helpful:
* Sitemaps are a great way for the user to navigate each of the pages you have setup
* To help with deciding where the information should go, use a technique call cad sorting.
* Card sorting places each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on an operating piece of paper.

### Wireframes:
* A wireframe sketches out a basic layout of how you want your website to look. 
* A wireframe ensures all the information the user needs is located on one page
* There are a handful of wireframe tools that can be used to layout your wireframe.

### Getting the message across: 
* Content of the website
* How it’s organized
* How you want to prioritize the information
* The visual hierarchy 
* Grouping similar items together, and maintaining similarities

### A great acronym I learned from one of my previous classes. 
C.R.A.P
* Consistency 
* Repetition 
* Alignment
* Placement

# HTML5 Layout:
For a long time, users would have to use <div> elements to group related items together. HTML5 created a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. 

### Various Inputs:
<Header>
<Footer>
<articles>
<aside>
<sections>
<figures ><figcaption >
Sectioning Elements <div >
Heading groups <hgroup>
Navigation <nav></nav>

### With a website you have three elements:
The body contains all of the content 
1. Header
    1. Navigation
2. Footer
    1. Unordered list
3. Main
    1. Images
    2. Paragraphs
    3. Articles

# Evolution of HTML:
* Various versions have been released over the years starting back in 1997 to today 2021. 

### Within HTML there have been several versions of HTML with different “doctype” over the years. HTML 5 utilizes this version of “doctype” to simplify the user interface.
* <doctype html>

### Characters within HTML:
* Comments <!- - Comments go here - ->

### ID Attributes with HTML:
* HTML elements can carry an ID attribute. ID attributes are used to uniquely identify an element from others within your code.
* HTML elements can also carry a class attribute. Class attributes allow you to put additional emphasis on a more important value. An example of a class attribute could be the need to post business hours of operations.

### Block Elements:
* Some elements in HTML will always appear to start in a new line within the browser window. These are known as “block-level” elements.
* Examples of block elements: <h>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>

### Inline Elements:
* Some elements will always appear to continue on the same lines as they’re neighboring elements. They are known as inline elements.
* Examples of inline elements: <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>

### Grouping text & Elements in a block:
* Div elements allow you to group a set of elements in one block-level block.
* <div> 

### Grouping text & Elements inline:
* A <span> element act like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. This is used to either contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from the surrounding text. The second way to use a <span> is to contain several inline elements.
* <span>

### Iframes:
* Iframes is like a little window that has been cut into your page - and in that window, you can see another page.
* Within an Iframe, you may find new attributes that are will be used for other parts of code creation.
* SRC - The SRC attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame
* Height - As it mentions this will dictate the height of the frame in pixels
* Width - This is the width of the image

### Information about your pages:
* The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. 
* <meta> is not visible to users but it fulfills several purposes such as telling a search engine about your page. 
* Within the <meta> contains the following:
    * A description
    * Keywords
    * Robots indicate whether search engines should add the page to their search results or not. 
    * Author, this defines the author of the page
    * Pragma prevents the browser from caching the page
    * Expires, because a browser often caches the content of a page, the expires option can be used to indicate when the page should expire. 

### Characters within HTML:
* < Less than
* > Greater than
* & Ampersand
* “ Quotation Mark
* ¢ Cent Sign
* £ Pound sign
* ¥ Yen sign
* € Euro Sign
* © Copyright 
* ® Registered trademark

* ` Left single quote
* ‘ Right single quote
* “ Left double quotes
* ” Right double quotes
* X Multiplication 
* ÷ Divide Sign
