### Version Control
Version control allows a user to look back at changes made to a file. With a traditional file setup you save a new file when you make a change to your project. That leads to multiple files being created and that can make it difficult to go back and locate previous changes made to the project.

### What is git?
Git stores data in a file system that consist's of snapshots in time. Every time you save a changed version of your project git creates a snapshot of the file and allows the user to refrence it as needed. The technical term for a snapshot is call a commit, which is data stored in a local database.

At the whole Git is Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). With Git you can have multiple programers working in teams on the same mirrored repositories. This allows for a colaborative effort between programer and promotes simltanious workflows. 

With Git there are various state that Git can reside.
- Commited: Data is secured in a local database.
- Modified: The file has been changes but not committed to the database.
- Stages: Flagged a file's change which is commited in the next snapshot.
