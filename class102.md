# What is Markdown?
###### Markdown provides a way to style text on the web. I can control the display of the information projected on the screen. This line is an example of a header at level 6 which is small. Comparatively H1 would be just one hashtag, and be quite large.

### Examples of a header
###### Each of the header has a corisponding number of hastags to determine the height. 
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H2
