# What is Markdown?
###### Markdown provides a way to style text on the web. I can control the display of the information projected on the screen. This line is an example of a header at level 6 which is small. Comparatively H1 would be just one hashtag, and be quite large.

# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H2

*This is how you italisize*

This is an unordered list
- Water plants
- Feed the venus fly tryp
- Ice cubes for Orchid

This is an ordered list
1. The sky is blue
2. The green waves in the wind
3. I am on an island

### This feature is both an H2 header, and a table of contents refrence
- [Code_102_Refrence_Markdown](class102.md)
- [Coders Computer](coderscomputer.md)

The table of contents aslo feature a link to a md.
[Name_Of Your_Item_To_Refrence] (name_of_your_md)

### If I want to refrence and image
![Your_Image_Of_Choice]
(WebsiteURL_of_the_image)

For image refrences you must have the exlamation point at the begining.
