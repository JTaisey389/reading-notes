### Growth Mindest
What Growth Mindset Means to me? 
<br> <br>Growth mindset for myself is like problem solving. When you a problem solving you are asking yourself what ways can you go about looking for the solution. While looking for that solution, you focus on different paths that can potentially lead to the correct or sometimes incorrect solution. In that time of focus you are allowing your mind to explore different possibilities of outcome. For me that is what I define as quitessential growth mindset, and allows myself to remain flexible in the moment. 

### *Reminders to keep in a growth mindset:*
##### 1. Critiscism is a professional way to show disagreement. Don't take criticism as the end all for the work that you have done, collaborate with those who share criticism and take it as a growth oportunity.
##### 2. It's easy to say I give up when your at the bottom of the pit, more often than not someone is climbing out of the pit and would be glad to offer help.
##### 3. Change is essential to growth. I use my resume as a refrence because the information on my resume is pretty consistent, I may feel the need to update the design on occasion. 

### Quotes
