### Growth Mindest
What Growth Mindset Means to me? 
<br> Growth mindset for myself is like problem solving. When you a problem solving you are asking yourself what ways can you go about looking for the solution. While looking for that solution, you focus on different paths that can potentially lead to the correct or sometimes incorrect solution. In that time of focus you are allowing your mind to explore different possibilities of outcome. For me that is what I define as quitessential growth mindset, and allows myself to remain flexible in the moment.
