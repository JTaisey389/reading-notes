### Growth Mindest
What does the Growth Mindset mean to me? 
<br> <br>A growth mindset for myself is like problem-solving. When you a problem solving you are asking yourself what ways can you go about looking for the solution. While looking for that solution, you focus on different paths that can potentially lead to the correct or sometimes incorrect solution. In that time of focus, you are allowing your mind to explore different possibilities of the outcome. For me, that is what I define as a quintessential growth mindset, and allows me to remain flexible in the moment.

### *Reminders to keep in a growth mindset:*
###### 1. Criticism is a professional way to show disagreement. Don't take criticism as the end-all for the work that you have done, collaborate with those who share criticism, and take it as a growth opportunity.
###### 2. It's easy to say I give up when you're at the bottom of the pit, more often than not someone is climbing out of the pit and would be glad to offer help.
###### 3. Change is essential to growth. I use my resume as a reference because the information on my resume is pretty consistent, I may feel the need to update the design on occasion. 

### In the words of Stephen Covey:
> Begin with the end in mind.
