# What is Markdown?
###### Markdown provides a way to style text on the web. I can control the display of the information projected on the screen. This line is an example of a header at level 6 which is small. Comparatively, H1 would be just one hashtag and be quite large.

### Examples of a header
###### Each of the headers has a corresponding number of hashtags to determine the height. 
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H2


### *Example of Italisizing text*
###### The asterisk is used to italicize text and give it some flair. Additionally, you can italicize specific words in a sentence for additional emphasis.
*This is how you italicize*

### This is how you create an unordered list
##### Unordered lists are a great way to organize information within a subject or topic. Multiple symbols can be used for a list such as -, +, *.

This is an unordered list
- Water plants
- Feed the venus fly trap
- Ice cubes for Orchid

### This is how you create an ordered list
##### A numerical list can easily be created by typing in numbers and a description.
This is an ordered list
1. The sky is blue
2. The green waves in the wind
3. I am on an island


### This feature is both an H2 header, a table of contents reference, and a link to a MD. 
The table of contents also features a link to an MD.
