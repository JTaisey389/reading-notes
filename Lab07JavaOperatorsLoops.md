# Operators and Loops

### Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions:
- You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. 
    - = = Is equal to
    - ! = Is not equal to
    - = = = Strict equal to
    - ! = = Strict not equal to
    - Greater than >
    - Less than <
    - Greater than or equal to > =
    - Less than or equal to < =

### Logical Operators:
- Comparison operators usually return single values or true or false. 
- Example:
((5 < 2) &&  (2 >= 3))
- (5 < 2) and (2 >= 3) "are the two expressions"
- && "are the logical operator"
- && "logical and"
- ll "Logical or"

### Loops:
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. The condition will be checked again and if it still returns true; the code block will run again. There are three types of loops
    1. For: If you need run code a specific number of time, use a **for** loop.
    2. While: If you are not sure as to how many times the code should be run, you can use a **while** loop.
    3. Do while: This loop is very similar to the **while** loop, but has one key difference. It will always run the command inside the curly braces at least once.
	Example: for (var I = 0; I < 10; I++) {
	document.write (i);
	}

### Loop Counters: 
- A **for** loop uses a counter as a condition. This gives instruction to the code to run a specific number of times. 
- Initialization: var I = 0;
- Condition: I <10;
- Update: i++

### Using while loops:
- Example: 
var i = l; // set counter to 1
	var msq = ' '; // Message
	// Store 5 times table in a variable
	while (i < 10 ) {
	msq += i + ' x 5 ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';	
	 i++;
	}
	document.getElementById('answer').innerHTML = msq;
