How Javascript makes web pages more interactive:

With Javascript you gain a lot of features to compliment the frame work and the design of your website:
1. Access content. - Javascript allows you to select any element, attribute, or text from a HTML page. 
    - This allows you to have a web page interact by accessing and modifying the content and markup used within a web page.
    - For example - Selecting the text inside all of the <h1> elements on a page
2. With Javascript you can modify the content to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
    - For example - change the size or position of a <img> element 
3. Programing rules. - You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow just like a recipe.
    - For example - A gallery scrip could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image. 
    -  Javascript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programing
4. Reacting to events. - Javascript can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
    - For example it could run when. - A button is pushed, a link is clicked or tapped, or a cursor hovers over an element

Examples of javascript in the browser: AMPR
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions for a browser to follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser

Javascript examples:
- Slideshows
- Forms
- Reload part of page
- Filtering data

A script is a series of instructions:
 -Like a recipe the input given to Javascript follows out a one-by-one order of operations. 
-An example of series of instruction is like a handbook. A company may provide you with a handbook for new employees that contain procedures to follow in certain situation. 
-And additional example is like an instruction manual. A manual often refers to a series of test to check the key functions of that specific item are working within the given perimeters. 

Writing a script:
- In order to write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
- With a script you should start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break down into smaller steps. 
    1. Define the goal
    2. Design the script
    3. Code each step

Designing script:
Here we look at a flowchart: This flow chart contains the task of a hotel cleaner
1. Check each room
    - Does the room need tidying? (Y)(N)
    - (Y) move to next step
        * Remove used bedding
        * Wipe all surfaces
        * Vacuum Floors
        * Fit new bedding
        * Remove used towels and soaps
        * Clean toilet, bath sink, surfaces
        * Place new towels and soaps
        * Wipe bathroom floor
    - (N) move to different task
        * Does the minibar need to be restocked? (Y)(N)
        * (Y) move to next step
            * Restock
        * (No)
    - Go to next room once all taskâ€™s completed

From steps to code:
-Vocabulary: The words a computer understands
-Syntax: How you would put those words together to create the set of instructions computers can follow.
