# Revisions in the cloud

### Version Control
Version control allows a user to look back at changes made to a file. With a traditional file setup, you save a new file when you make a change to your project. That leads to multiple files being created and that can make it difficult to go back and locate previous changes made to the project.

### What is git?
Git stores data in a file system that consist's of snapshots in time. Every time you save a changed version of your project git creates a snapshot of the file and allows the user to reference it as needed. The technical term for a snapshot is called a commit, which is data stored in a local database.

On the whole, Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). With Git you can have multiple programmers working in teams on the same mirrored repositories. This allows for a collaborative effort between the programmers and promotes simultaneous workflows. 

With Git there are various states that Git can reside.
- Committed: Data is secured in a local database.
- Modified: The file has been changed but not committed to the database.
- Stages: Flagged a file's change which is committed in the next snapshot.
